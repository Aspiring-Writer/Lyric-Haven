# 02. Robot Love
Waking up to sounds of text messages and typing in my ear\
Just can't wait to check your e-mail\
I beg and beg, baby connect with me instead

Technology sucks (sucks!)\
I wish I could change all your numbers, put your phone under water\
And if you gadgets spoke back\
I would have to ask why you won't let down\
You such a home wrecker

Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
My boyfriend's in love with a robot

Table for three we got a third wheel\
Me and you and your artificial intel\
You can't keep your hands off her\
She's beep beep beeping over every other word

Technology sucks (sucks!)\
I wish I could change all your numbers, put your phone under water\
And if you gadgets spoke back\
I would have to ask why you won't let down\
You such a home wrecker

Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
My boyfriend's in love with a robot

How can I save you now\
Love's not mechanical\
Sometimes I wanna be...

Stomping on your phone (sucks!)\
Busting up your laptop\
No more, no more, no more robot

Stomping on your phone (sucks!)\
Busting up your laptop\
No more, no more, no more robot

Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back

My boyfriend's in love with a robot

Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, give me my, give me my baby back\
Oh na na, HEY!
