# 03. Just Like You
You're textin me to say\
You made a mistake\
Couldn't say it face to face

You thought you wanted her\
You got what you deserved\
Now look who's getting played

They say karma goes around\
I Used to want you\
But I don't now

Roses are dry\
Violets are black\
And I can be cruel\
Just like you

Tables have turned\
Can't help but laugh\
For saying we're through\
Just Like You

You hit me up again\
To tell me I'm the one\
But I just hit erase

'Cause I'm so over it\
I'm finally havin' fun\
So drama go away

They say heartache\
Heals in time\
Whoever they are\
Well, they were right


Tell me what she worth\
Was she worth\
Letting me go

Shovel in your hand\
And you're digging yourself a hole

Now you're coming back\
Just to hear me tell you no\
Oh yeah, yeah

Comes around\
Used to want you

Oh
