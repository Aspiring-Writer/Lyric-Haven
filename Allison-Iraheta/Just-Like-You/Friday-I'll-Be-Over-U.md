Oh yeah!

Monday, Tuesday, we were cool\
Wednesday, I found out 'bout you\
Caught my heart by tellin' lies\
You weren't what you advertised

But silly me, to believe\
I-I-I was unique\
When I'm gone, you put on a show\
Oh-oh-oh, you gotta go

'Cause what's true about you?\
Who are you when I'm gone?\
Wanted to be with you\
Don't know what I was on\
Cause you got me, to forget me\
Oh-oh-oh\
You know that's true\
Yeah you got me, to forget me\
So Friday I'll be over you

Oh yeah!

No no, I ain't gonna cry\
Go and be with her tonight\
I reallly don't care what you do\
Cause Friday I'll be over you

And silly me, to believe\
I-I-I was unique\
When I'm gone, you put on a show\
Oh-oh-oh, you gotta go

'Cause what's true about you?\
Who are you when I'm gone?\
Wanted to be with you\
Don't know what I was on\
Cause you got me, to forget me\
Oh-oh-oh\
You know that's true\
Yeah you got me, to forget me\
So Friday I'll be over you

Oh yeah!\
Oh yeah!

Silly me, to believe\
When I'm gone you put on a show\
Oh-oh-oh, you know that's true!

Oh, oh

Cause you got me, to forget me\
Whoa\

So Friday I'll be over you

'Cause what's true about you?\
