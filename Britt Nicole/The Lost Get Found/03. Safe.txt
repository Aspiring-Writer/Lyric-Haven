
You keep trying to get inside my head,
While I keep trying to lose the words you said
Can't you see I'm hanging by a thread,
To my life what I know, yeah I'm losing control and
Oh no, my walls are gonna break
So close, its more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away
When love just isn't safe
You're not safe

I'm strong enough, I've always told myself
I never want to need somebody else
But I've already fallen from that hill,
So I'm dropping that guard here's your chance at my heart and

Oh no, my walls are gonna break
So close, its more than I can take
I'm so tired of turning and running away
When love just isn't

Everything you want, but its everything you need
It's not always happy endings but its happy in between
Its taken so long, so long to finally see
The other isn't worth the risk

Oh no, my walls are gonna break
Oh no, my walls are gonna break
So close, its more than I can take
So tired of turning and running away
When love just isn't safe

Oh no, my walls are gonna break
So close, its more than I can take
So tired of turning and running away
When love just isn't safe

You're not safe
And that's okay
