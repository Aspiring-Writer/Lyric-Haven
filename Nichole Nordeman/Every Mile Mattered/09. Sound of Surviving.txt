
[Verse 1]
They told me
I'd never get to tell my story
Too many bullet holes
It would take a miracle
These voices
Inside my head like poison
Trying to steal my hope
Silencing my soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But my story is only now beginning
Don't try to write my ending
Nobody gets to sing my song

[Chorus 1]
This is the sound of surviving
This is my farewell to fear
This is my whole heart deciding
I'm still here, I'm still here
And I'm not done fighting
This is the sound of surviving

[Verse 2]
These pieces
The ones that left me bleeding
Intended for my pain
Became the gift You gave me
I gathered those pieces into a mountain
My freedom is in view
I'm stronger than I knew

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And this hill is not the one I die on
I'm going to lift my eyes and
I'm going to keep on climbing

[Chorus 1]
This is the sound of surviving
This is my farewell to fear
This is my whole heart deciding
I'm still here, I'm still here
And I'm not done fighting
This is the sound of surviving

[Bridge]
I'm still here
Say it to the ache, lying there awake
Say it to your tears
I'm still here
Say it to the pain, say it to the rain
Say it to your fear

[Chorus 2]
This is the sound of surviving
This is my farewell to fear
This is my whole heart deciding
I'm still here, I'm still here
And I'm not done fighting
No, I'm not done fighting
And I am still rising, rising
I'm still rising
And I'm not done fighting
This is the sound of surviving
