
I need an aspirin after you
Until you left I never knew what my heart was really going through
And I never wanna go back but if there's some sick twist of fate
I would rather rest in peace please do not resuscitate

I'm still breathing.
Don't you think I'm not
Because you're leaving?
Never gonna see me grieving
I'm moving up and away.
Not crying
Funny I'm not even trying
Never gonna lay down
I'm breathing much better
The air is much clearer over you


Suffocating. and I didn't know why
Until I realized you were standing in the way of my air supply
Clear the air, was about to die
I wonder why I didn't leave you way before so I thought I was insane
But it was you who kept the oxygen from getting to my brain

I'm still breathing.
Don't you think I'm not
Because you're leaving?
Never gonna see me grieving
I'm moving up and away.
Not crying
Funny I'm not even trying
Never gonna lay down
I'm breathing much better
The air is much clearer over you

Over you! Over you!

Over your head.
Out of your view
Breathing so much better
Now that I'm away from you

I'm still breathing.
Don't you think I'm not
Because you're leaving?
Never gonna see me grieving
I'm moving up and away.
Not crying
Funny I'm not even trying
Never gonna lay down
I'm breathing much better
The air is much clearer over you
