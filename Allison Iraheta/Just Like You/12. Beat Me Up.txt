
You like to keep me on a chain, chain, chain
Change your mind or change your ways, ways, ways
You got me running through a maze, maze, maze
I know this isn't just a phase, phase, phase

You always pick me up
And then you hold me down
I'll never let you go

Cause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you 'cause you heat me up, heat me up
And that's why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running 'cause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up

You always make me do those things, things, things
Shut me up then make me sing, sing, sing
You love it when I scream your name, name
But you, get your kicks out of causing me pain, pain, pain

You always pick me up
And then you hold me down
I guess you'll never know

Cause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you 'cause you heat me up, heat me up
And that's why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running 'cause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
I love you even though you beat me up, beat me up

And I really don't care
What they say about me
'Cause he gives me everything I want
And they don't know what it's like
When you need somebody
'Til the point they can do no wrong (point they do no wrong)
We always fight and then I open up my door

Cause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you 'cause you heat me up, heat me up
And that's for every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running 'cause you fix me up, fix me up

Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
I still love you 'cause you heat me up, heat me up
And that's why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running 'cause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby, just beat me up, beat me up
I love you even though you beat me up, beat me up
