
I got myself to blame for this
Got myself to blame for
My difficult days and my difficult ways
But you, you know how to let things slide
I'm perfect in your eyes
You don't see all the damage in me

There's simply no one else in the world I could ever find
Likes me when I'm low and still tolerates me when I'm high
You, you got me down
You kept coming round
There's simply no one else I could lean on a thousand times
Still be there again, and again and never lose his mind
You know me so well that you can't even tell
That you're like no one else
That you're like no one else

No, nothing's ever what it seems
But you always seem to be
Who you are even when it gets hard
And you let me kick you to the floor
And you still come back for more
You're too good what did I do to deserve you?

There's simply no one else in the world I could ever find
Likes me when I'm low and still tolerates me when I'm high
You, you got me down
You kept coming round
There's simply no one else I could lean on a thousand times
Still be there again, and again and never lose his mind
You know me so well that you can't even tell
That you're like no one else
That you're like no one else

I told you I'd never love you
You said it would be okay
You had enough love for us anyway
I told you I'd never need you
But you only proved me wrong again
I pray to God that never ends

There's simply no one else in the world I could ever find
Likes me when I'm low and still tolerates me when I'm high
You, you got me down
You kept coming round
There's simply no one else I could lean on a thousand times
Still be there again, and again and again, and never lose his mind
You know me so well that you can't even tell
That you're like no one else
That you're like no one else

You know me so well
You can't even tell
That you're like no on else
That you're like no on else
