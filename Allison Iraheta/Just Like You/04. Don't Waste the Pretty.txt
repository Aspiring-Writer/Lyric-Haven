Get to what we're talking about
Do what we're talking about
Don't try and hide it now
Why keep on working it out?
You can't keep working it out

'Cause I see how he's putting you down
I just can't be around
Whatcha doing this for?
'Cause the light in you started to fade
Don't let it get away
Girl you're worth so much more

But don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away
So don't waste the pretty on life
'Cause soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way, you gotta see
Don't waste the pretty

Sit back and breathe it in
Look at how lucky we are
Look at how lucky we are
This life we're livin' in
You gotta follow your heart
You know I'm never too far

Away from the pain in your eyes
I can see your disguise
But it's not too late (It's not too late)
'Cause I know you can turn this around
Don't be scared, work it out
And listen when I say (Listen when I say)

Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away
So don't waste the pretty on life
'Cause soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way, you gotta see
Don't waste the pretty

And just in case you need remindin'
Well, you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And there is ain't use in you hiding
'Cause you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful

Don't waste the pretty on him (Him)
Don't waste the pretty on pain (Pain)
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away (Don't give it away)
So don't waste the pretty on life
'Cause soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way, you gotta see
Don't waste the pretty

Yeah
Don't waste the pretty, don't waste the pretty (Don't waste the pretty)
Don't, don't
Don't waste the pretty, don't waste the pretty
Don't, don't
Don't waste the pretty, don't waste the pretty, don't waste the pretty

(Well, you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful)
Don't waste the pretty, don't waste the pretty
Don't, don't
