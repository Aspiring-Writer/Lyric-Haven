
Did I say something stupid
There goes one more mistake
Do I bore you with my problems
Is that why you turn away

Do you know how hard I've tried
To become what you want me to be

Take me...

This is all that I've got
This is all that I'm not
All that I'll ever be

I got flaws
I got faults
Keep searching for your perfect heart
It doesn't matter who you are
We all have our scars
We all have our scars

You say don't act like a child
But what if it's a father I need
It's not like you don't know
What you got yourself into
Don't tell me I'm the one who's naive

Do you know how hard I've tried
To become what you want me to be

Take me...

Come on just let it go
These are things you can't control
Your expectations
Your explanations
Don't make sense to me

You and your alternatives
Don't send me to your therapist
Deep down I know what you need
And I'm not sure that's what I want to be

Take me...
