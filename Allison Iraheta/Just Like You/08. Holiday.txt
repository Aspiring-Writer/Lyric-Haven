
Here I am
In a brand new shade of blue
Stumble as I go
Into mythdom ???
I watch for miles and miles
To get through all the pain

But I'm ok
I'm ok
Here I go

Our life has changed like a holiday
Feels so damn good like Hollywood
I'm gonna I'm gonna
Shove this life in your face
Gonna give you a taste

Let's get it on
Got the wheels hit the ground
These rockin' roads
Ain't gonna slow our joyride down
I'll ride for miles and miles
Naked in the rain

And I'm ok
I'm ok
Here I go


Our life has changed like a holiday
Feels so damn good like Hollywood
I'm gonna I'm gonna
Shove this life in your face
Gonna give you a taste

Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna turn your world around
Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna turn you upside down

Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna turn your world around
Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna turn you upside down

Our life has changed like a holiday
Feels so damn good like Hollywood
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Shove this life in your face
Gonna give you a taste
Our life has changed like a holiday
Feels so damn good like I knew it would
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Shove this life in your face
I'm gonna give you a taste


Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Give you a taste
Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Give you a taste
Hey yeah, Hey Yeah, Hey yeah
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Give you a taste
