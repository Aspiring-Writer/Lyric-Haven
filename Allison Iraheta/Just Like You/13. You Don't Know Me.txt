
I'm a ghost of a girl that you looked right past
I'm a voice you didn't wanna hear
I'm a page in a book that you read too fast
But I'm still here

We never kept, never tried, never even asked
Maybe I didn't wanna say
You shut your eyes, told your lies then you had your laugh
And that's ok

Cause you don't know me
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry
For who I am, for what I feel
Cause you don't know me (you don't know me)

I got more on my mind that I've never told
I've got pain that you've never felt
I've got the scars, I can deal with it on my own
I've got stories that I'll never tell
But maybe it's just as well

Cause you don't know me
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry
For who I am, for what I feel
You don't know me

I'm strong, I'm a mess
Altogether an emotional wreck
I can scream, I can beg you to see I'm alive
I'm awake, I'm glued, I'm not gonna break down now

Cause you don't know me
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry

Cause you don't know me (cause you don't know me)
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry (and I'm not sorry)
For who I am, for what I feel

Cause you don't know me (cause you don't know me)
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry (and I'm not sorry)
For who I am, you don't understand just how I feel
Cause you don't know me
