Maybe I need you, maybe I won't
Well someday I want to, but right now I don't
Is it so hard to understand I'm just a girl without a plan?
You hold on too tight, or take a few steps back tonight

I don't need you to save me, I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me how to live before I learn
And if I fall apart and if it breaks my heart
Well I still got all the pieces
That you gave me, that you gave me

Maybe you'll tell me, I told you so
But maybe my screw ups is how I will know
Why can't you let me hit the ground
I like I'm lost and can't be found
I don't wanna fight but take a few steps back tonight

I don't need you to save me, I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me how to live before I learn
And if I fall apart and if it breaks my heart well I still got all the pieces that you gave me.
Don't need you to save me

I know it's easier to control
Is it that hard to let go
Don't tell me the end before I fall

Maybe I'll need you but maybe I won't
Well someday I'll want to, but right now I don't

I don't need you to save me, I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me how to live before I learn
And if I fall apart and if it breaks my heart
Well I still got all the pieces that you gave me. (the pieces that you gave me)

I don't need you to save me, I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me how to live before I learn
And if I fall apart and if it breaks my heart (my heart)
Well I still got all the pieces that you gave me, the pieces that you, that you gave me.
