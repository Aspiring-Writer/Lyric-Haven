
I could slip
So easily into you
If I let myself go
I could let
My wildest dream come true
You never know
How it's gonna wind up in the end
Will we be lovers or not even friends?

Trouble is,
I like the taste too much and I can't think straight
People change,
And will you still be here after today
Trouble is,
I feel like I could win or lose it all
I don't know which way to fall

Don't forget, the promises that we made
When I got on the plane
We'd be back together once again
And we would stay the same
Sometimes I think love can last
But sometimes I think forever is the thing of the past

Trouble is,
I like the taste too much and I can't think straight
People change,
And will you still be here after today
Trouble is,
I feel like I could win or lose it all
I don't know which way to fall

Na na na na na na na na (multiple times)

Everything's so temporary.
Hold too tight and things just slip away
And then you hold me
I'm in place

Trouble is,
I like the taste too much and I can't think straight
People change,
And will you still be here after today
Trouble is,
I feel like I could win or lose it all
I don't know which way to fall

Na na na na na na na na (multiple times)

I don't know which way to fall
