
In the night
He is with you
At morning light
He is with You
Do not fear
For He is with you
When I'm not here
He is with you

I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
No, I couldn't love you more
But somebody does
Jesus

Rest your eyes
He is with you
I pray you find
He is with you
When I let go
He is with you
And I can know
That He is with you

I couldn't love you more
No, I couldn't love you more
No, I couldn't love you more
But somebody does
Jesus

You are mine for a moment
But you are His
Forever His
And in this life
I am holding You
But in His arms you live

I couldn't love you more
No, I couldn't love you more
No, I couldn't love you more
Oh, but somebody does
Jesus
