I'll tie Your love around my neck
I'll write Your words upon my heart
Lord, I won't forget how good You are

I'll dwell upon Your faithfulness
I'll rest within Your promises
And when I'm walking through the dark
Lord, I won't forget how good You are

I will trust, I will trust You
I will trust you, Lord, with all my heart
And I won't forget how good you are
No, I won't forget how good You are

You gave me everything I have
And my whole life is in Your hands
When what I fear is closing in
Lord, Your faithfulness will never end
You're faithfulness will never end

I will trust, I will trust You
I will trust you, Lord, with all my heart
And I won't forget how good you are
No, I won't forget how good You are

And even in the darkness, even in the questions
Even when the hardest times of life are at hand
Yeah, even in the darkness, even in the questions
Even in the times that I'm not meant to understand

Oh, I will trust, I will trust You
I will trust You, Lord, with all my heart
Oh, I will trust, I will trust You
I will trust You, Lord, with all my heart
And I won't forget how good You are
No, I won't forget how good You are

Even in the darkness, even in the questions
Even when the hardest times of life are at hand
Even in the darkness, even in the questions
Even in the times that I'm not meant to understand
