
I wanna hold on 'cause I'm afraid
And I didn't ask for it to be this way
Somehow I found myself caught in the gray
Reaching out for fear, running out of faith

You know what I don't so help me to let go
You're in control so help me to let go
I wanna let go

I wanna let go of what I can't change
'Cause I can't wrap my mind around Your ways
I've got more questions than I have answers these days
Please don't let my suffering go to waste

You know what I don't so help me to let go
You're in control so help me to let go
I wanna let go, I wanna let go

These are the moments it's hard to believe
So please help me, please help me
These are the moments of surrendering
So please help me, please help me, please help me

'Cause You know what I don't so help me to let go
You're in control so help me to let go
You're in control so help me to let go
I wanna let go
