
Mother in a waiting room
Wondering if she'll hold him soon
In the darkness searching for some light
People say, "It'll be alright"
People tell you to hold on tight
But what do you have to hold onto tonight?

Where will you find peace when you cry?
In these hard times it's not in what you hold on to
It's in the one who's holding you tonight

It's like staring down a wishing well
The voice inside cries out for help
But you've never felt so helpless in your life
And time becomes the enemy
'Cause you just got to wait and see
While all the world is simply passing by

Where will you find peace when you cry?
In these hard times it's not in what you hold on to
It's in the one who's holding you tonight

You are safe in the arms of the Father
You are safe in the arms of the Father
You are safe in the arms of the Father

You are safe in the arms of the Father
You are safe in the arms of the Father
You are safe in the arms of the Father

Where will you find peace when you cry?
In these hard times it's not in what you hold on to
It's in the one who's holding you tonight

Where will you find peace when you cry?
In these hard times it's not in what you hold on to
It's in the one who's holding you tonight
