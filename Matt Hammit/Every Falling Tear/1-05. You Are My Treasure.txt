
Oh, I have a hope, I have a treasure
I have found a place
Where I have no need for my earthly possessions
And my worries just fade away

And when sickness and death are at my door
Trying to steal from me
Oh, they cannot take what I've already laid down
At Jesus feet

You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever

And I have a peace that I don't understand
When I know where I stand with You
And I already have everything that I need
And You're all that I have to lose

And when sickness and death are at my door
Trying to steal from me
No, they cannot take what I've already laid down
At Jesus feet

You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever
You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever

All my hope, all my hope
All my hope is You
All my hope, all my hope
All my hope is You

You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever
You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever

You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever
You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever
You are my treasure
Your love lasts forever
