
I don't wanna waste another day, I don't wanna wait another night
To tell You everything that's on my mind
Maybe I've said it all before but this life is just too short
To miss the chance to tell You one more time

There's no life without You
There's no life without You
Life without You is incomplete
Like setting sail without a sea
There's no life without You, Lord

Looking for another moving mountain
Or a dead man brought to life
But I don't wanna miss You
When You're right before my eyes

And I don't wanna love You for a blessing
I just want to know who You are
'Cause You could never give me something better
Than Your light in my heart

There's no life without You
There's no life without You
Life without You is incomplete
Like setting sail without a sea
There's no life without You

And all will be well with my soul
When all I'm chasing is Your love
Oh, all will be well with my soul
When all I'm chasing is Your love

There's no life without You
There's no life without You
Life without You is incomplete
Like setting sail without a sea
There's no life without You

There's no life without You
There's no life without You
Life without You is incomplete
Like setting sail without a sea
Life without You is chasing the wind
Trying to fill my loneliness
There's no life without You
