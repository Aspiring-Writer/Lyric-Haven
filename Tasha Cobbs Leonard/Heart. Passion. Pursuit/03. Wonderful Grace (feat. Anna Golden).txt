The wonderful grace of Jesus
Greater than all my sins
How can a song describe Him?
Where shall my praise begin?
Taken away my burdens
Setting my spirit free
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Always reaches me
Oh yes it does

[Verse 1: Anna Golden]
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Greater than all my sins
How can a song describe Him?
Where shall my praise begin?
Taken away my burdens
Setting my spirit free
The wonderful grace of Jesus
It always reaches me
It always reaches

[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
It's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Oh the grace that found me
It's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Yes it was Your grace that found me

[Verse 2: Tasha Cobbs Leonard &amp; Anna Golden]
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Deep as the roaring sea
It runs to the most forgotten
It runs through eternity
It says I'm a child of heaven
It says I'm forever free
The wonderful grace of Jesus, Jesus
It says I'm a child of heaven
It says I'm forever free
The wonderful grace of Jesus!

[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
And it's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Oh the grace that found me
Yes It's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Yes it was the grace that found me
Beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Oh the grace that found me
Yes it's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Yes it was the grace that found me
Yes it's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Oh the grace that found me
Yes it's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Yes it was Your grace that found me

[Post-Chorus: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
It was Your grace that found me
Say it was (it was Your grace that found me)
And I'm mighty grateful
It was Your grace (it was Your grace that found me)
I didn't deserve it, Lord, it was Your grace
(It was Your grace that found me)

[Bridge: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Amazing grace
Oh-oh-ooh amazing grace
It always reaches
(Amazing grace)
Oh-oh-ooh... (amazing grace)
It always reaches
(Amazing grace, it always reaches)
Amazing grace, yeah... (it always reaches)
Amazing grace, it always reaches
Amazing grace, it always reaches

[Outro: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
It says I'm a child of heaven
It says I'm forever free
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Always reaches me
