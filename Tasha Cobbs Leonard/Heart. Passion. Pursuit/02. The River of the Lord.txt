I'm running to the river
I'm going back to the river of the Lord
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Take me back to the river
Where I first believed
Take me back to that moment
Where freedom I received
Heaven knows where I would be
If it wasn't for Your mercy
My sins are now forgotten
Yet You remember me
Singing...

[Chorus 1]
Hallelujah
Praise to the Lord
Faithful to deliver
Faithful to restore
Hallelujah
Sing out my soul
'Cause all my sins are washed away
In the river of the Lord

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oooh

[Verse 2]
I'm coming back to the reason
That I first belived
I'm coming back to that hour
Where freedom I received
So take my heart surrender
Take every part of me
And drench me in the water
'Til is only You I see
Come and drench me in the water
'Til is only You I see
Singing...

[Chorus 2]
Hallelujah
Praise to the Lord
Faithful to deliver
Faithful to restore
Hallelujah
Sing out my soul
'Cause all my sins are washed away
In the river of the Lord
Hallelujah
Praise to the Lord
Faithful to deliver
Faithful to restore
Hallelujah
It is well with my soul
'Cause all my sins are washed away
In the river of the Lord
Hallelujah
Praise to the Lord
Faithful to deliver
Faithful to restore
Hallelujah
Oh Yes it is well my soul
'Cause all my sins are washed away
In. the river of the Lord
Say...
