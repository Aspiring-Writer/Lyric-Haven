Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, no other name
Oh, the name of Jesus
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, no other name
Oh, the name of Jesus

[Verse]
On Christ the solid rock I stand
No other help I know
All other ground is sinking sand
I trust in You alone
Where fear is great, our God is greater
We stand unshakable!..

[Chorus 1]
In the name (in the name)
In the name of our God
In the name (in the name)
In the name of our God
All mountains be moved
Chains now be loosed
In the name (in the name)
In the name of our God
