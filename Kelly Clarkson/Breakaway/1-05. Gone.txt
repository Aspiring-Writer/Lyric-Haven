
What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real
From what isn't there

Your eyes they sparkled, that's all changed
Into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn

You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered, never open
Nothing matters when you're broken
That was me whenever
I was with you

Always ending, always over
Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster
I am breaking that habit
Today

You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn

You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
"Sorry" doesn't cut it babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone

Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn

You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

I'm already gone
I'm already gone
(Gone, gone)
Already gone
I'm gone
