This is Beautiful Disaster

[Verse 1]
He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I try to save him
My whole world would cave in
It just ain't right
Lord, it just ain't right

[Chorus]
Oh, and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Lord, would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster?

[Verse 2]
He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But do I try to change him?
So hard not to blame him
Hold me tight
Baby, hold me tight

[Chorus]
Oh, and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Lord, would it be beautiful?
Or just a beautiful disaster

[Verse 3]
I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy hysterical
I'm searching for some kind of miracle
Waited so long
I've waited so long

[Bridge]
He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the end, he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

[Chorus]
Oh, and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
He's such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Lord, would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster?

[Outro]
He's beautiful
Lord, he's so beautiful
He's beautiful
Thank you!
