
Money, sex, and power are good

''What? You want me to listen to who?
I don't know ... I used to like Trip Lee when he first came out
But I be feelin' like he be actin' like money is a sin or something
I don't know. What he talkin' 'bout now?''

Let me get this off my chest, I know some folks gon' be mad
Ain't tryna start no mess, but I know how folks gon' react
Feel I gotta strive and press, tell what I mean till they see that
They think I got a problem with dollars and making green cash
But money really ain't the problem, every grand is a grant from the Father
When I said we can't serve both God and cash, many folks thought I meant "don't bother"
But I ain't saying making money ain't right, I'm just saying that your money ain't Christ
Please don't bow down to them greenbacks and let them stacks rule your life
Ain't tryna say we shouldn't get paid, I ain't tryna say that we should stay broke
But money don't mean you got favor, being broke don't mean that you don't
Money is a gift that's good, give it to the Father, to the giver
I've been misunderstood but I trust in the God who delivers

Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God in praise
You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood

I got something on my mind, bro, some folks might not like that
Feel like it's about that time to hit 'em with the truth where that light's at
But still some folks wanna fight that, his hand that feeds wanna bite that
'Cause they think pleasing is making demons of all that he made, but despite that
He brings good gifts like sex, I ain't tryna start no mess
And I don't wanna get graphic with all the facts 'cause he gave it so that he can be blessed
Please don't act like I'm gone, please don't just say I'm wrong
Just take a couple looks in the Word, you'll see this he condones it
Sex ain't the problem, it's sinners who just forgot him
Distorting, corrupt like Sodom, the gifts, they want 'em without him
It's beautiful in it's proper place, until we prop it up
And turn our footsteps from his face, and then we robbin' him

Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God in praise
You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood

Last verse, still gotta be real, submit my thoughts under his will
Even if it ain't really what I feel, gotta let him take that-take that wheel
Last thing to talk about, before end of discussion
I heard power corrupts, no it just shows our corruption
But power's really a blessing to men and to resurrection
And build it to help this mess of a world in which we're resting, mayne
Our heart's the issue so submit it to the good Lord
He will replace it, what you think we call him good for?

Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns
It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say
Don't exalt them over the God in praise
You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
The gifts and the Giver are good
Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood

''Ok, ok. I think I got what he talkin' 'bout now
It ain't that money, power and sex are the problem
It's that something is wrong with my lil', my own lil' heart
I don't know, we'll see ... still think that man trippin'''
