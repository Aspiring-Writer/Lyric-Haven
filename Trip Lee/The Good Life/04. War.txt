
This is war like you ain't seen
This winter's long, it's cold and mean

When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight, it's death and life

This the kind of war you ain't never seen ever
Soldiers getting rocked homie, heads get severed
Death toll is crazy like nothing on record
Civilians ain't safe, man, the troops might get ya
Can't run or hide 'cause them guys gon' catch ya
They never get tired, never let up
They fired up, wired up to put you on the stretcher
But is the good side tough enough? You bet'cha
Yeah you got bad guys, you know they a problem
Trying to overthrow the King, death is what we call 'em
No life from the dark nights, no Gotham
This ain't fake death, no possum, can anybody stop them?
Tombstones everywhere, dead bodies rotting
Big glocks popping, bodies still dropping
But I ain't gon' cry though, 'cause Death'll get swallowed
The Father sent his Son, and the troops gon' follow

This is war like you ain't seen
This winter's long, it's cold and mean

When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight, it's death and life

The Son came down to the wasteland we in
A death-filled mess, he'll win, no leaving
No rest till Death's killed, the fight ain't even
And death won't be left still breathing (get 'em)
The Son's on the front line crossing their borders
Invading enemy land but they can't thwart 'em
A good troop betrays him, and they ain't even force him
But God used that sin to support him
They captured the King, next thing them shots ring out
General is down, the troops are like, "We out!"
The life-giver dies and the other side celebrates
But they don't know that Hell is fate, the death they'll face
They never safe, he's a beast who lifts featherweights
Just when they thought they took him down, he would elevate
Death could never take pride in that blow
'Cause the King beat death when he died and he rose

This is war like you ain't seen
This winter's long, it's cold and mean

When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight, it's death and life

It really might seem like the war's still going
People still dying, sin is still potent
The devil's still tempting, and evil ain't slowing
Just wait until the trumpet gets blowing
The General is coming with keys in his hands
The death and haters, they'll freeze where they stand
'Cause see they've been defeated, please understand
That they don't wanna see him, bro, the King is the man
He's a man of war, a beast on the battlefield
Obliterating all the evil forces that'll kill
Where's your sting, death? Oh, you don't got it bro
Where's your victory? Oh, you've been swallowed whole
But when he's back, ain't no fighting Jehovah
He'll toss you in a lake of burning fire and sulfur
He's a titan, a soldier who will wipe away tears and our fears
And all the pain and death will be over

This is war on sin and death
The dark will take its final breath

When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle, ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight, it's death and life
