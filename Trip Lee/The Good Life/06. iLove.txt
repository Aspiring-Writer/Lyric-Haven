
My girlfriend's name starts with an "I"
Shines bright like stars in the sky
Stays by my side, when it's dark, she the light
She befriends many and we get lost in her eyes
Staring at her 'stead of watching our steps
Run to her when we wake without catching our breath
She's addicting ... the truth: we're fiends
But we ain't sniffing glue, we just glued to the screens
She rules us, see the proof when she rings
Probably take two of her over two human beings
Her sisters, some bigger, some smaller
Sync her with them daily to keep her in order
Get her when she drops even if we can't afford her
Ask me if I really need her, I'd be like, "sorta"
But when I seen her at the mall, had to court her
I keep her in accessories, your boy do spoil her
I want her in my life, I'd do anything for her
Forget about a dime boy, she more like a quarter
With her all the time, there ain't nobody cooler
See her, little jealous man, and I don't wanna lose her
So instead of spending time with others
She only lets me talk when I talk through her

But iLove
But still I, still iLove
I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down, but can't help myself
ILove
C'mon, you know I'm in iLove
I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down, but can't help myself

She's really affecting how my life goes
She controls me, I might go psycho
I can't think now, mental light bulb
Weighty thoughts are pushed out by her light shows
Community's gotta take a back seat
I try to talk to others, but I'm feeling mad weak
There's always something I can laugh at, something I can look up
She keeps me entertained till I barely ever look up
And when I try to get up in the text
She's tapping on my shoulder, to read another text
Look, I thought she'd really be the best
I told her she a heavy ball and chain around my neck
She got mad like, "You got a better date?"
I had to man up, time to regulate
Look, I told her if she ain't gon' let me meditate
Then for my sake, we gotta separate
Don't wanna hurt her, I don't wanna abuse her
But she's only there for me to use her

ILove
You know this is iLove
I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down, but can't help myself
ILove
You know this is iLove
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
But I gotta put her down just to help myself
