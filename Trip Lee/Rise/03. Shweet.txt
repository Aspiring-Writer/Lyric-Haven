
Get them hands in the air
Make a little noise in the stands if you there
Brag on the Godman if you dare, only if you dare
That'd be shweet
What if when you brag it wasn't 'bout the clothes with the tags?
That'd be shweet
What if when you brag it was 'bout him who's the first and the last?
That'd be shweet

I heard them talking like they hot man
Somebody got them gassed up, on that octane
Look I hate to tell them they ain't better
Better get a umbrella, God reigns

Let's go back in time to late eighties
D town hold me down, that's where they made me
When I'm back there, I ain't vaca-ing
Feels like I'm home, thinking about staying, I ain't staying though
Ooh already already
Lone star state bred, how could I forget it
But I ain't pop up out the blue
It's fly how he knit me, I ain't talking 'bout the shoe, shoot
I got a lot of problems but I'm straight, that's shweet
I know my God will toss them in the lake, that's shweet
How many times I gotta tell you he's the boss and to him anything's a piece of cake?

I been in the A a lot this year
Perfecting these songs that I spit here
And ever since 2010 it's been clear
Everybody talking 'bout you gotta live here, I think they got me now
Ooh, already already
Lone star state bred, how could I forget it?
Middle school we was bumpin swisha house though
Had our freestyles sounding like them swisha house flows
Saying, "man hold up, I done came down
Trunk pop, gripping grain, baby stay down"
Wasn't talking 'bout nothing, but a pipe dream
Like, "man my wrist froze like ice cream"
But he opened my eyes, bruh
All my people was surprised, bruh
'Cause I used rap bout cash, that I never really had
Then I came alive, bruh

They say they make it happen
But they really only try
My God is the captain, he can really make it happen
He been reigning in the sky
They say they make it rain
They really only throw cash
But my Lord's running in his own lane
Makes rain fall and the thunder crash
We think we tell time
But we really only reading our clock
My God existed before time
And he told it when to start, mouth drop
We say we got it in control
But that's really a mirage
My God, he can keep the world running
While directing all the planets and the stars, shweet

Everybody go and brag that's shweet

That's shweet
Not sweet but shweet
With a s, h bro
Yessir
I was built to brag
